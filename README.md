## 4. How to use async / await keywords in Swift | Swift Concurrency #3
 Just because we are in a task, using await, in an asynchronous environment, does not mean we are in a different thread than the main. It might mean that, and often it does, but not always.
 So it is a good idea to switch to the MainActor before updating UI.

## 6. How to use Async Let to perform concurrent methods in Swift | Swift Concurrency #5
 Async let . . a sort of asynchronous constant
 Great for executing multiple asynchronous functions at once and then awaiting the result of all
 those functions at the same time.
  - a lot of code
  - not scallable
  - up to 3 requests, if more, other ways to do it -> Task Groups maybe . . next video
